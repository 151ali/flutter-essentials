# Introduction

`Flutter` is Google's UI toolkit for crafting beautiful,
natively compiled applications for mobile,
web, and desktop from a single codebase.

It is based on `Dart`, an OOP language,
it's a statically typed language,
(for me it's almost identical to Typescript)

There is `three master pieces` of every flutter application:

- Business logic (dart)
  `functions, classes, types, conditions...`

- UI (flutter)
  `columns, rows, list-views, grid-views, images...`

- Packages (pub.dev)
  `wifi, camera, http, preferences...`
